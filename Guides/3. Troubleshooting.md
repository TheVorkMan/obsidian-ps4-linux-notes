# General

#### 1. Payload crashes the PS4.
   Older GoldHEN beta v2.4b18.8 is **broken**!
   Update by replacing `payload.bin` in `/data/` with FTP!
   Or sticking USB with a new version.
   Otherwise, if you have v2.4b18.9 and higher, retry.
#### 2. Scripted external/internal installation produces an error.
For example: `mount -o ro /newroot failed`
It means initramfs can't find your distribution partition or archive for whatever reason.
If you do external - check if your ext4 partition **LABEL** (not **Name**) is set to `psxitarch`.
Refer to Dionkill's wiki [Common issues](https://dionkill.github.io/ps4-linux-tutorial/issues.html#installation-issues)
You should try making [manual partition](https://dionkill.github.io/ps4-linux-tutorial/external-installation-manual.html). Scripted install is tricky.
Also, try using @vvsx87 initramfs: [[2. Links#Initramfs]]
# Internal installation issues

#### 1. External boots. Internal doesn't want to boot.
   - First check if you put all files at correct spots.
     `bzImage` and `initramfs.cpio.gz` (and `bootargs.txt`) at `/data/linux/boot/`
      `psxitarch.tar.xz` at `/user/system/boot/`

Make sure that there **no other files** in these directories expect those!
   - Check if you used a correct `initramfs` (`Internal` instead of `External`!)
	
Still doesn't work? Try running with these installed:
- GoldHEN version 2.4b18.6
- Use a recommended feeRnt's 6.15.4 kernel -  [[2. Links#Kernels]]
