## General information
0. Don't use old guides to install your linux! [Dionkill's tutorial](https://dionkill.github.io/ps4-linux-tutorial/)
1. Make sure you are using up to date payloads!
2. And make sure you're using **up-to-date** boot files!
3. Use a TV, if monitor connected to a PS4 after rebooting in to the linux doesn't output.
4. Try disabling HDCP, it **can** cause issues!
5. Hard-reset and retry, maybe a second one.
6. Change kernel (bzImage).
7. When hot-pluging (switching without reboot) monitors - refresh the screen by changing TTY.
## Possible cases
#### 1. Terminal appears, but screen goes black after boot (or after login):
It means that X11 display server doesn't work properly. 
Reboot. Twice. Trice.
But, if that doesn't work, Wayland *should* work and be better.

If it's happening on login, change Plasma (X11) to Plasma (Wayland) with dropdown list in bottom-left. Otherwise...

Switch TTY. If your distro uses KDE Plasma desktop enviroment:
`dbus-run-session -- startplasma-wayland`

If your distro uses Xfce desktop enviroment:
`startxfce4 --wayland`

If any other, change the distro.

#### 2. After running the payload, no output - LED strip has changed from white.
2. Use a TV instead of a monitor.
3. Change kernel (bzImage).
Contact us on discord server if it doesn't work.

#### 3. LED is still white:

3. Hard-reset and retry, maybe a second one.
