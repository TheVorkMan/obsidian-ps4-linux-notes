##### 1. `pacman` produces an error when installing packages
```
error: restricting filesystem access failed because Landlock is not supported by the kernel!
error: switching to sandbox user 'alpm' failed!
```

This issue applies to Arch Linux and it's derivatives (CachyOS, EndavourOS)
You simply need to enable one thing in config.

Go to pacman.conf: `sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf`
Find the `#DisableSandbox` and remove the `#`
(if there's no such option - just write it in options section)
Save and exit `nano`: Ctrl+S, Ctrl+X
##### 2. `pacman` outdated keys
When `pacman` gives error about unsigned packages when updating the system, update keyring.
`sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring`
