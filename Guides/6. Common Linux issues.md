#### 1. `pacman` produces an error when installing packages
This issue applies to Arch Linux and it's derivatives (CachyOS, EndavourOS)
You simply need to enable one thing in config.

Go to pacman.conf: `sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf`
Find the `#DisableSandbox` and remove the `#`
(if there's no such option - just write it in options section)
Save and exit `nano`: Ctrl+S, Ctrl+X
