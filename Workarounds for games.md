WineD3D (OpenGL) works pretty stable. 
DXVK 1.10.3 (Proton 8 and lower) works much better than modern versions of DXVK.
To use latest Proton with an older DXVK, you can use: https://github.com/pythonlover02/Proton-Sarek uses an older Vulkan API version, which doesn't crash GPU. So use that if you encounter issues.

## Minecraft 1.21.11+ prevent glitching
1. Install resourcepack **NoOutline** from modrinth. It will fix glitches everytime you look at blocks. Water still will glitch out.
2. Use older versions, you can connect to newer server with ViaFabric mod.
3. Vulkan can fix these, but for now it's just crashes the GPU completely.
