# Regarding PS4 Linux as a whole
#### NOTE PLEASE: it's STILL in testing form, no ready distros, no gurantee, only experimentation! If you think that you have better things to do... 
#### Then don't start this shit!

anyway, let's get to this
# Basic Linux knowladge:
#### 0. Google, or ask ChatGPT for the meaning of something not written here, learn the basics!
#### 1. "Switch TTY"
   TTY is a Display and has terminal, graphical sessions (X11, Wayland) and many more on it running.
   Usually, there's seven of them available to the user.
   To switch TTY, you need to press `CTRL+ALT+Fx` - where `x` is a number from 1 to 7.
   By default - `CTRL+ALT+F7` usually will switch you to the display where graphical session is running (unless you manually run it), and TTY on `F1` up to `F6` has TTY (or simply, a terminal) 
#### 2. Some abrevations and words:
	DE; WM; X11; Wayland; DM
   Desktop Enviroment: Full desktop enviroment, usually with it's own Window Manager.
   It's your KDE, XFCE, GNOME, LXQt, LXDE, and many, many more.
   
   Window Manager: Lightweight, deals with windows. DEs run on them and can be run separately.
   
   X11 (Xorg) - X Display Server: centralised window system. It's available on all DEs and most of WMs. It's quite old, has an expiremental fork - X11Libre - it's not recommended though. May create some problems, but generally works ok.
   
   Wayland - Display Protocol. Was designed like a decentralised system. Tends to replace X11. A better option on PS4.
   
   Display Manager - the thing that logs you in your graphical session. It's usually a graphical one, like:
   - LightDM (usually used with XFCE, works in X11), 
   - SDDM (usually used with KDE, by default runs in X11, can be run in Wayland),
   - GDM (usually used with GNOME, works in Wayland).
